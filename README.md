This repository contains the necessary components for preparing a dataset for banana disease image classification, training and evaluating a banana disease classifier, and deploying it to a web application. Specifically, it contains
  - Data engineering files such as scripts used to preprocess and split the dataset,
  - Classification models and Jupyter notebooks clearly documeting the training and evaluation process of the models, and
  - The Flask web application that requests predictions from the best-performing banana disease classification model.
